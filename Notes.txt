## CONCEPTS

concepts : version control (why, how), branches, commits, stashes, tags, versions (major / minor), messages, remote, repository, mirror / fork

## HOW TO CREATE A GIT PROJECT

create (from existing project / from scratch) / clone / fork / gitignore

## BASICS

status / add (/remove) / commit / push / log / fetch / pull / 
branch (create / delete)
stash (store / pop / list)
reset

## GIT IN A TEAM

cf rapport stage G2

git flow, branches, features, commit names / conventions, what to do in case there's a mistake, code review / pull (/merge) request / merge, CI, lint

avoiding and managing conflicts (worst case scenarios, safety (rebase) branches)

history management (amend, rebase, squash)

------------------------------------------------

General hands-on :
	- Must regroup all use cases
	- Regroups all git-related steps for a typical "work session"
		=> retrieving the existing work, creating a new branch, working on it, committing changes, etc.

For each use case : 
	- Cheatsheet and steps to reproduce (with commands).

Use cases :
1. I want to start working on a project.
	- Create a projet from scratch.
	- Work on an existing team project.
	- Fork an existing project.

2. I want to work on a project.
	- Branches (create / delete / rename / list), commits (add only some files, all files, etc.) and stashes.
	- Organize my local commit history.
	- status / add / commit / push / log

3. I want to contribute to a team project.
	- Manage conflicts (force push).
	- Manage conflicts when everything goes wrong (reset, delete).
	- Pull request / code review.

4. I want to share my project
	- GitHub pages.

------------------------------------------------

TO DO :
- Add a part in concepts about teamwork (conventions, etc.)
- Add links in concepts to the different use cases.
